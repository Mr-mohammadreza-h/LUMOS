# Fixed-Point Arithmetic Unit with Multiplier and Square Root Calculation

This repository contains the implementation of a Fixed-Point Arithmetic Unit (FPU) in Verilog, a testbench for verification, and an example assembly code to demonstrate its use. The FPU supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and square root operations on fixed-point numbers.

## Project Structure

- `Fixed_Point_Unit.v`: Verilog module implementing the FPU with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and square root operations.
- `Fixed_Point_Unit_Testbench.v`: Testbench for verifying the FPU functionality.
- `Assembly.s`: Example assembly code demonstrating the usage of the FPU.
- `Assembly.txt`: Machine code corresponding to the assembly code.
- `Defines.vh`: Contains macro definitions used in the Verilog code.

## Modules and Implementation Details

### Fixed_Point_Unit

#### Bit Selection for Multiplication Result

The result of the multiplication operation in the `Fixed_Point_Unit` is selected as follows:

```verilog
`FPU_MUL    : begin result <= mult_result[WIDTH + FBITS - 1 : FBITS]; ready <= mult_ready; end
```

Here, `WIDTH` is the bit-width of the operands, and `FBITS` is the number of fractional bits in the fixed-point representation. The multiplication of two `WIDTH`-bit fixed-point numbers results in a product of `2*WIDTH` bits. To maintain the fixed-point format, the result is shifted right by `FBITS` bits.

#### 32-bit Multiplier Implementation

The 32-bit multiplier is implemented using four instances of a 16-bit multiplier. The partial products are generated and combined to produce the final result. 

- **Partial Product Generation**:
  - Step 1: Multiply lower 16 bits of both operands.
  - Step 2: Multiply upper 16 bits of operand 1 with lower 16 bits of operand 2.
  - Step 3: Multiply lower 16 bits of operand 1 with upper 16 bits of operand 2.
  - Step 4: Multiply upper 16 bits of both operands.

- **Final Addition**:
  - The partial products are shifted appropriately and added together to produce the final 32-bit result.

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
begin
    if (reset) begin
        mult_state <= 0;
        mult_ready <= 0;
        mult_result <= 0;
        partial_product_1 <= 0;
        partial_product_2 <= 0;
        partial_product_3 <= 0;
        partial_product_4 <= 0;
        mult_op1 <= 0;
        mult_op2 <= 0;
    end
    else if (operation == `FPU_MUL) begin
        case (mult_state)
            0: begin
                mult_op1 <= operand_1[15:0];
                mult_op2 <= operand_2[15:0];
                mult_state <= 1;
            end
            1: begin
                partial_product_1 <= mult_intermediate;
                mult_op1 <= operand_1[31:16];
                mult_op2 <= operand_2[15:0];
                mult_state <= 2;
            end
            2: begin
                partial_product_2 <= mult_intermediate << 16;
                mult_op1 <= operand_1[15:0];
                mult_op2 <= operand_2[31:16];
                mult_state <= 3;
            end
            3: begin
                partial_product_3 <= mult_intermediate << 16;
                mult_op1 <= operand_1[31:16];
                mult_op2 <= operand_2[31:16];
                mult_state <= 4;
            end
            4: begin
                partial_product_4 <= mult_intermediate << 32;
                mult_state <= 5;
            end
            5: begin
                mult_result <= partial_product_1 + partial_product_2 + partial_product_3 + partial_product_4;
                mult_ready <= 1;
                mult_state <= 0;
            end
            default: mult_state <= 0;
        endcase
    end
end
```

### Square Root Calculator

The square root calculation is performed using a digit-by-digit method, which iteratively finds the digits of the square root. 

#### Implementation

- **Initialization**:
  - Extend the precision of the input number by shifting left by `FBITS * 2`.
  - Initialize the bitmask and other variables.

- **Calculation**:
  - For each bit position, update the temporary calculation variable `y` and the current result `q`.
  - Check if the temporary variable `y` is less than the input number and update `q` and `y` accordingly.

- **Completion**:
  - The final value of `q` after all iterations is the square root of the input number.

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        sqrt_state <= IDLE;
        root_ready <= 0;
        root <= 0;
        x <= 0;
        q <= 0;
        m <= 0;
        y <= 0;
    end else if (operation == `FPU_SQRT) begin
        case (sqrt_state)
            IDLE: begin
                x <= {operand_1, {WIDTH{1'b0}}}; // Shift left to account for fixed-point
                m <= 1 << (2*WIDTH - 2);
                y <= 0;
                q <= 0;
                sqrt_state <= CALCULATE;
                root_ready <= 0;
            end
            CALCULATE: begin
                if (m != 0) begin
                    if (y < x) begin
                        q <= q | (m >> (WIDTH - 1));
                        y <= y + m + (q << (WIDTH - 1));
                    end else begin
                        y <= y - (q << (WIDTH - 1));
                        q <= q >> 1;
                    end
                    m <= m >> 2;
                end else begin
                    sqrt_state <= DONE;
                end
            end
            DONE: begin
                root <= q;
                root_ready <= 1;
                sqrt_state <= IDLE;
            end
            default: sqrt_state <= IDLE;
        endcase
    end
end
```
